### Project: Employee & Department Insights Dashboard using SQL and Power BI

**Overview**  
The main goal of this project was to create a dashboard to provide actionable insights into employee performance, salary distribution, departmental budgets, and project details. It aims to help identify potential financial and performance risks, especially focusing on whether any projects or departments might go over budget or fall short on performance metrics. Additionally, it looks at whether current budgets will sustain expenses over the next two years.

### Problem Statement

The dashboard addresses two primary questions:
1. Which projects and departments are at risk of going over budget or underperforming?
2. Can the existing budgets cover all anticipated expenses for the next two years?

### Steps Taken

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   - **Data Import:** Collected raw data from multiple sources and imported it into MySQL.
   - **Field Selection:** Filtered data to keep only the fields that were essential for the analysis, improving accuracy and relevance.
   - **Combining Data:** Used SQL joins and unions to combine datasets from different tables, allowing related data points across tables to be linked.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation in SQL**  
   - **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, standardized formats, and ensured consistency across datasets.
   - **Data Transformation:** Converted data types and derived new metrics where necessary to support in-depth analysis.

3. **Data Integration & Visualization in Power BI**  
   - **Database Connection:** Connected Power BI directly to the MySQL database, enabling efficient data import and updates.
   - **Additional Cleaning & Transformation:** Applied final cleaning and transformations in Power BI to refine the dataset for visualization.
   - **Calculated Columns & Measures:** Created additional metrics (like average performance per department and budget allocation per project) to enable KPI tracking.
   - **Dashboard Design:** Created interactive visuals, including charts, tables, and filters, to present salary distribution, employee performance, departmental budgets, and project status.

### Key Insights

The interactive dashboard provides insights that help in:
   - **Effective Workforce Management:** By assessing employee performance, the dashboard allows stakeholders to manage the workforce efficiently.
   - **Financial Risk Awareness:** With an overview of departmental and project budgets, it highlights potential financial risks.
   - **Project Performance Monitoring:** Visuals on project progress support ongoing performance evaluation.
   - **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Filtering controls and tailored insights enable informed decisions on budget planning and resource allocation.

### Learnings

- **SQL Proficiency:** Enhanced understanding of advanced SQL techniques for data cleaning, transformation, and dataset merging.
- **Power BI Integration:** Developed skills in connecting MySQL with Power BI, creating real-time visualizations.
- **Dashboard Design:** Improved ability to design dashboards with filtering options to cater to stakeholder needs.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Enhanced troubleshooting for data inconsistencies and achieved accuracy in the final visualization.
